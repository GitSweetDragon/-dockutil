# -dockutil

INTRODUCTION
Hi there !

I'm new to Jamf Pro and Github => (September 2022).

For business reasons, I decided to move our company's macs from Azure AD to Jamf Pro.

So I spent time training myself to understand how Jamf works and to be able to start deploying our macs with this solution.
I still have some issues with JamfConnect and Unlock but that should be fixed soon.

I would like to thanks @kcrawford for dockutil, its a great app ! https://github.com/kcrawford/dockutil

After testing different configurations and scripts, I ended up not finding the one that works on my environment:

Jamf Pro Cloud version 10.42
Apple M1 version 12.6.1
Dockutil version 3.0.2

I deploy Dockutil in service with office then I launch my strategies.

LICENSE

Like i said i new on Github so i don't what's i should input on licence, you can use my code has you want and customize it. 

CHANGELOG
......

Notes: 
I intentionally added several custom folders so that you can see the render and remove what you want afterwards.
I don't know if we can customize the url icons or say to open them with google for example.
Feel free to share your feedback or suggestions in the comments.
thank you for your indulgence in advance.
