# My Custom Dockutil

**INTRODUCTION**

Hi there !

I'm new at Jamf Pro and Github => (September 2022).

For professional reasons, i decided to move our corporate macs from Azure AD to Jamf Pro.

So I spent a lot of time training to understand how Jamf works and to be able to start rolling out our Macs with this solution.
I still have some problems with JamfConnect and Unlock but this should be resolved soon.

I would like to thanks @kcrawford for dockutil, its a great app ! https://github.com/kcrawford/dockutil and the Github community for sharing code and experience. and also bloger like : 

 - https://scriptingosx.com/
 - https://sachinparmarblog.com/
 - https://travellingtechguy.blog/ 
 - And of course https://community.jamf.com/ ;) 

After trying different configurations and scripts, which didn't work for me, I decided to share with you my custom configuration which works in my environment.

**MY ENVIRONMENT**

 - Jamf Pro Cloud version 10.42
 - Apple M1 version 12.6.1
 - Dockutil version 3.0.2

I deploy Dockutil & Microsoft Office in PreStage Enrollments then I launch my strategies.

**THE GOAL**

- After deploying applications such as Office, remove the default dock and set the corporate one, but allow the user to modify it afterwards.

**LICENSE**

 - Like i said i new on Github so i don't what's i should input on licence, you can use my code has you want and customize it. 

**CHANGELOG**
......

**NOTES**
I intentionally added several custom folders so that you can see the render and remove what you want afterwards.
I don't know if we can customize the url icons or say to open them with google for example.
Feel free to share your feedback or suggestions in the comments.
thank you for your indulgence in advance.
